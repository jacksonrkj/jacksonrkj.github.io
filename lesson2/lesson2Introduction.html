        <p>One of the important skills that you need to master to develop web and development is to be able to interact with the DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM is a JavaScript object that represents a web page and contains references to all of the HTML elements and CSS used on the web page. The DOM allows you to write JavaScript code that allows you to access and manipulate the values and CSS associated with one or more elements on the web page.</p>

        <p>The DOM can be accessed directly in native JavaScript. In addition, several JavaScript frameworks have been developed in JavaScript to make it easier to access and manipulate the DOM. It is important to know and understand how to use the DOM using native JavaScript before learning how to use these frameworks. This will give you the foundation needed to learn and more effective use these JavaScript frameworks.</p>

        <p>In this lesson you will learn first learn how to manipulate and to access the DOM elements using native JavaScript and then you will be introduced to the JQuery JavaScript framework.</p>
